# Skills


## Communication

Communication comes in so many different formats, and through my professional life, identifying and understanding how different people like to be communicated with has allowed me to understand more about my strengths. One of the most valuable communication skills I have found is the ability to listen and really understand through careful and intentional questioning and (confirming) I have understood. This allowed future communication to be both relevant to my customer/colleagues needs and allowed me to be able to (tailor/shape/ my messaging blah)

## Agility

Able to adapt and change in new roles with new information  
Enjoy learning new skills, ways of working  
Not fixed in having to do things in a fixed way

## Collaboration/Teamwork

Can working individually and as part of a team  
Ability to keep a group on task

## Strategic and Commercial Awareness

Ability to see the big picture  
Return on investment (get the most out of time)

## Customer Focused

I have previously had my biggest success keeping the customer at the center of my work. Whilst having my own objectives and targets, by ensuring I fully understood the needs of the customer and confirming that we are on the same page throughout a project meant we both gained as much as we could from working together.

## Public speaking and presentation skills

I enjoy and have had success taking technical information and tailoring presentations to an audience. This including facilitating clinical discussions amongst healthcare professional, including doctors, nurses, dietitians some of whom were recognised specialists in their fields.

Daily I would present to groups of between 2 and 50 attendees and whilst my presenting skills are strong, a strength highlighted to me by previous managers and colleagues was to be able to use my presentation to facilitate discussion amongst attendees which meant a more meaningful interaction for everyone

## Problem solving
